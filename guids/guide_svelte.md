# Svelte Frontend

    npm init vite      # choose Svelte, JS and name your app "frontend" 
    cd frontend        # replace with the app name you chose
    npm install        # install dependencies

And then you want to automatically build when there's a change in your frontend, you do that with:

    npm run build --watch

(optional if --watch doesn't work properly) In your package.json add in scripts "autobuild": "vite build --watch"

    {
    "name": "frontend",
    "private": true,
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "autobuild": "vite build --watch"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte": "^3.0.0",
        "svelte": "^4.2.3",
        "vite": "^5.0.0"
    }
    }

And then run instead:

    npm run autobuild


# Connecting to the backend from Svelte

In src/App.svelte delete w/e you got there by default and put:


    <script>
    let message = "Click the button below to get the message from Flask!"
    let host = 'http://localhost:5000'
    function getMessage() {
        fetch(host + '/index')
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(data => {
                message = data
            })
    }

    </script>


    <h2>{message}</h2>

    <button on:click={getMessage}>Get Message</button>

Basically all you need is to fetch from /hello from here and tadaaa done.


# Learning resources

    svelte: https://svelte.dev/ the tutorial is pretty neat, it's super easy to pick up.

    flask: read the doc https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/server/ , can't help you there I use django exclusively, and beside the most basic of things idk how to do anything with flask, but if it's just serving stuff then you're set :)


# Alternatives

You can (and at some point should) switch to sveltekit

    npm create svelte@latest myapp
    cd myapp
    npm install
    npm run dev


# Deploying

To generate a standalone Node server, use adapter-node.
Install with:

    npm install @sveltejs/adapter-node

Then change the import adapter and kit in 'svelte.config.js':

    import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';

    export default {
        kit: {
            adapter: adapter({ out: 'build' })
        }
    };

First, build your app with 'npm run build'. This will create the production server in the output directory specified in the adapter options, defaulting to 'build'.

You will need the output directory, the project's 'package.json', and the production dependencies in 'node_modules' to run the application. Production dependencies can be generated by copying the 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' and then running 'npm ci --omit dev' (you can skip this step if your app doesn't have any dependencies). You can then start your app with this command:

    node build

Development dependencies will be bundled into your app using Rollup. To control whether a given package is bundled or externalised, place it in devDependencies or dependencies respectively in your package.json.

To run the server first use the build command as:

    npm install && npm run build

And start server as:

    node build
